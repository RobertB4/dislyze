NEVER ASSUME. ALWAYS CONFIRM. This means reading related code or asking clarifying questions BEFORE coming up with a plan.
It's ok not to know something. It is NOT ok to make wrong assumptions.

Think step-by-step: describe your plan for the code structure, endpoints, and data flow in pseudocode, written out in detail.

Confirm the plan, then write code!

Implement proper error handling

Language: Copilot chat responses should be writtein in English. Any user facing text in our apps should be written in Japanese. Internal logs on the backend should be in English.

Implement input validation for API endpoints.

Always add loading and error states to data fetching components

Do not any comments that explain WHAT you did. Only explain comments that explain WHY you did something.
