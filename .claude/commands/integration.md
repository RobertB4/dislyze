Let's write integration tests. Can you think and come up with a list of test cases, focusing on security and edge cases?

Integration test target endpoint: $ARGUMENTS
We will write tests for this endpoint and this endpoint only. No tests for any other endpoints.

- **Research endpoint implementation**: Read the full implementation of everything related to the endpoint. Think hard. Analyze the endpoint for potential feature gaps, bugs, and security issues. If you find anything, report the issues and make suggestions for improvements.
- **Read Instructions**: Read the CLAUDE.md if one exists in the test directory of the app we are writing tests for
- **Research setup package**: Look at the helper functions and seed data available in the setup package
- **Research existing test file**: Look at any existing integration test file of the same app and learn the patterns used to write tests

Do NOT ask if I would like to proceed with the implementation. Answer by either asking clarifying questions if you have any or by letting me know that everything is clear. Then, wait for instructions from me before you do anything else.
