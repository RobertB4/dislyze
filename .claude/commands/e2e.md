Let's write e2e tests. Can you think and come up with a list of test cases, focusing on security and edge cases?

We will write e2e tests for: $ARGUMENTS

- **Research feature implementation**: Read the full implementation of everything related to the feature we want to test. Think hard. Analyze the feature for potential gaps, bugs, and security issues. If you find anything, report the issues and make suggestions for improvements.
- **Read Instructions**: Read the CLAUDE.md if one exists in the test directory of the app we are writing tests for
- **Research setup package**: Look at the helper functions and seed data available in the setup package
- **Research existing test file**: Look at any existing e2e test file of the same app and learn the patterns used to write tests

Do NOT ask if I would like to proceed with the implementation. Answer by either asking clarifying questions if you have any or by letting me know that everything is clear. Then, wait for instructions from me before you do anything else.
