Before we write code, let's come up with a plan.

## What we want to plan

#$ARGUMENTS

## Important rules

* If you are unsure of something, ask me clarifying questions. NEVER ASSUME OR GUESS - always confirm if you are unsure.
* Come up with multiple solutions and list there pros and cons.
* Spend time reading and understanding dependencies and related code. Make sure you understand the full picture first before coming up with a plan.
